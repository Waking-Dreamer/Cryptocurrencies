# Unsupervised Machine Learning with Cryptocurrencies

This project worked with a data file containing info about cryptocurrencies from CryptoCompare. The cryptocurrency data file was cleaned and unsupervised machine learning was used to carry out dimension reduction with PCA and clustering prediction using K-means. The results were visualized using a data table, a scatter plot, and a 3D scatter plot.
